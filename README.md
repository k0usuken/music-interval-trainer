# Music Interval Trainer

This is a web application designed to help music students practice identifying musical intervals. It displays a two-note chord on a staff, and the user must select the correct interval from a list of options. The app provides instant feedback, plays the chord audio, and tracks performance statistics like elapsed and average time.
